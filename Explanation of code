For the first question, the approach we have used is to collect all the dates present in the dataframe and then to remove all the dates of filing, which will only give back dates
of violation. We have created a function called 'new_search' which will take as it's parameters each of the reports present in the dataframe, the date to be searched in that 
particular report and the number of words to be searched before and after the location of the date. This way, if we see the words 'LITIGATION', 'FILED' or 'MODIFIED' or any words
associated with 'SEC' very nearby the date, we can omit that date since it is a date of filing.

For the second question, we used 'PERSON' label of en_core_web_lg to print all the people/company names

The third question was a combination of the first and second questions. We used the new_search function again (from the first question) to go through the dataframe and identify 
people associated with SEC by checking the people who have anything related to SEC anywhere near them. 'SEC','THE SEC','SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION', 'THE SECURITIES AND 
EXCHANGE COMMISION' were the words used to check

The fourth question employed the usage of 'ORG' label present in en_core_web_lg and thenwe removed all instaces of SEC from the output (Since it will return SEC also as an 
organization). Again, 'SEC','THE SEC','SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION', 'THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISION' were the words used to check

The fifth question used the 'MONEY' label present in en_core_web_lg to get all the dollar amounts
